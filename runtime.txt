The results for the doublerInsert goes faster with smaller arrays.  As the array increases, the doubleAppend outperforms the doublerInsert function.  The array.push scales up linearly, while the array.unshift scales quadratically.  I would say the doubleAppend is better because the runtime is faster as the size of the input array gets larger.
